Implementation of Own Doubly Linked List Class

In this repository, I have an implementation of a class named {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}}. This class behavior is a simplified implementation of the {\ttfamily std\+::list}. Class {\ttfamily list} represents a container which organizes stored objects with a so-\/called doubly linked list. A doubly linked list is basically a list of nodes which are connected among each other. \end{quote}
The doubly linked list data structure is implemented as shown in the following figure\+:



For each object that is to be stored, a new node is internally created by class {\ttfamily list}. Besides the object to store, each node has two pointers; {\ttfamily prev} and {\ttfamily next}. {\ttfamily prev} points to the previous node, {\ttfamily next} points to the next node.

The first node ({\ttfamily head}) and last node ({\ttfamily tail}) are special nodes since in these cases {\ttfamily prev} or {\ttfamily next} do not point to a predecessor or successor. When adding the first object to the list, an initial node is being created which represents the first and last node at the same time.

Another special node is the {\ttfamily beyond\+\_\+tail} node. It is a a placeholder node which is the successor of the last node stored in the list. The main purpose of this node is to be used by the method {\ttfamily end()} to return an iterator with it. That is to conform with the STL container conventions that never returns an iterator pointing to a valid (last) object. As this element acts as a placeholder/sentinel, any attempt to access its object results in undefined behavior.

Full and detailed examples of uses and tests of the class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}} are given in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{main_8cpp}{main.\+cpp}}} file. Each method and operator is very carefully tested (e.\+g., calling pop\+\_\+front() on an empty list, ..., etc.).

An example test run is shown in the following screenshot\+:

The following design and implementation criteria are followed\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{No C/\+C++ standard functions or classes are used}} to realize {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}} class. This include, e.\+g., {\ttfamily size()}, {\ttfamily push\+\_\+back()} and of course using {\ttfamily std\+::list} or similar as an internal representation of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means own functions/methods are developed and implemented to do all required operations.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}} is made generic such that any type can be stored within its nodes. â€¢ The class has a {\bfseries{default constructor}} that initializes it to an empty list.
\item For now, {\bfseries{error handling}} is implemented in a simplified fashion. The {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}} class implements an exception-\/based error handling for various error cases. Example\+: Calling {\ttfamily pop\+\_\+front()} on an empty list shall result in an appropriate exception. Note that some errors may not be handled. This may be done later. {\bfseries{Use this class at your own risk}} \+:).
\item The code follows \href{https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html}{\texttt{ LLVM Coding Standards}}.
\item The {\itshape \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case}{\texttt{ sanke\+\_\+case}}} naming convention is used for variable and function names (with few exceptions).

To allow iterating {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}}, a simplified version of the iterator concept is implemented. the class {\ttfamily iterator} as a so-\/called nested class is added to the to the public part of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classutil_1_1list}{util\+::list}}}. THe following functionality is implemented for this {\ttfamily iterator}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily operator==}\+: Two iterators are equal if they point to the same node
\item {\ttfamily operator!=}\+: Two iterators are equal if they point to different nodes
\item {\ttfamily operator++}\+: Point/\+Go to the next node element. Both {\bfseries{prefix and postfix}} variants are supported.
\item {\ttfamily operator$\ast$}\+: Return a reference to the object stored in the current node
\item {\ttfamily operator-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}\+: Return a pointer to the object stored in the current node

The following methods are implemented\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily T\& front()}\+: Gives access to the first element of the list
\item {\ttfamily T\& back()}\+: Gives access to the last element of the list
\item {\ttfamily empty()}\+: Returns true, if the list does not contain elements
\item {\ttfamily size()}\+: Returns the amount of stored objects
\item {\ttfamily clear()}\+: Clears the list
\item {\ttfamily void push\+\_\+back(const T\& element)}\+: Adds element to the end of the list
\item {\ttfamily void pop\+\_\+back()}\+: Removes the last element from the list
\item {\ttfamily void push\+\_\+front(const T\& element)}\+: Adds element to the front of the list
\item {\ttfamily void pop\+\_\+front}\+: Removes the first element from the list
\item {\ttfamily display()}\+: print the list elements and size to the standard {\ttfamily outstream}
\item {\ttfamily begin()}\+: Returns an iterator which points to the first element of the list
\item {\ttfamily end()}\+: Returns a special iterator which points to a placeholder node ({\ttfamily beyond\+\_\+tail}) which is the successor of the last node stored in the list.
\item {\ttfamily insert(iterator, const Object\& element)}\+: Adds element one position before the object iterator is currently pointing to. Iterator can be the {\ttfamily end()} iterator. Returns an iterator pointing to the newly added element.
\item {\ttfamily erase(iterator)}\+: Erases the object iterator is currently pointing to. Returns an iterator to the successor of the erased object. iterator must be valid and dereferenceable. For that reason, the {\ttfamily end()} iterator cannot be used as a parameter.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Notes for the above methods and to follow the spirit of how class std\+::list behavior. \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily T} represents the actual type, not a node.
\item when calling {\ttfamily front()} and {\ttfamily back()}, they do not return nodes.
\item {\ttfamily push\+\_\+front()} or {\ttfamily push\+\_\+back()} do not taking nodes as arguments. They take the actual data element.
